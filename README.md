DAC Attack!
===========

A small [SP/DIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/PDIF) to
[line-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level) audio adapter design.
The intended use case is with some versions of
[ZuluSCSI](https://zuluscsi.com/), though the design should work with any
SP/DIF compatible output source.

This project is made available under the CERN Open Hardware Licence
strongly-reciprocal variant version 2, available at [LICENSE](LICENSE).

This is a PROTOTYPE and has received no testing so far. More information will
eventually be provided once the design has (hopefully) been verified.
